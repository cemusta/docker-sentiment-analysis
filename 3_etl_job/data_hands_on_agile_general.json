Therefore it is not unreasonable to think of a Scrum Master as a more limited scope since the concepts of Scrum are more limited than Agile and the role of Scrum Master is more clearly defined.\n\nHowever a Scrum Master is also supposed to be on a quest for improvement so it is not unreasonable to see much overlap in the skills and knowledge and even the  experience of the two roles, depending on the organization.\n\nHowever, generally, a coach of Agile Development tends to hold a larger perspective than a single team, or even set of teams.  They are also not bound by Scrum principles, or concepts.\n\nI would expect anyone to be a Scrum Master with a limited amount of training, the right attitude and willingness to learn.\n\nFor Agile Development coaches I expect more formal education in coaching and deeper understanding and appreciation of Agile and a broader knowledge of disciplines, methodologies, thought processes, approaches, implementation strategies.\n\nTo take this a step further Business Agility Coaches tend to have an even broader skillset, with understanding of org design, leadership, all or some business aspects including lean portfolio management as well as various areas of the business that are not traditionally considered Agile development such as HR, Finance, Marketing, etc.\n\nIf you are looking for a fixed list of skills you will find it but you won't find agile there. Agile coaching, scrum master, servant leader, facilitator,  etc, belong on a spectrum with a great amount of overlap depending on the culture and needs of the organization."}]}]}], "thread_ts": "1600371898.469200", "parent_user_id": "U5X781CKE"}], [{"client_msg_id": "846ae102-2a09-476b-a132-566671094fb7", "type": "message", "text": "Pretty pleased with myself there :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:", "user": "U2UVCQ4ET", "ts": "1600332393.454600", "team": "T2PT41LM9", "blocks": [{"type": "rich_text", "block_id": "YEBd", "elements": [{"type": "rich_text_section", "elements": [{"type": "text", "text": "Pretty pleased with myself there "}, {"type": "emoji", "name": "rolling_on_the_floor_laughing"}]}]}], "thread_ts": "1600332393.454600", "reply_count": 32, "reply_users_count": 6, "latest_reply": "1600360886.465400", "reply_users": ["U2WJRF8QN", "U2ZUSLTFY", "U3K3ESCA1", "U2UVCQ4ET", "U2PV3PG3C", "U2VJNL9MW"], "subscribed": false, "reactions": [{"name": "joy", "users": ["UQVGR2S4E", "U2WJRF8QN", "U012U11AY5P", "U30EWH38V", "UB4LHBTND", "U019SGTBTM1", "UENMXAU0L", "U3FQ3ALQ0", "U2PV3PG3C", "U2VJNL9MW", "UQJ038JDN", "UAFMHG6P7"], "count": 12}, {"name": "100", "users": ["UQVGR2S4E", "U6HV2GBJ7", "UAFMHG6P7"], "count": 3}, {"name": "clap", "users": ["UM0K6B31S", "UCJ1XHT0S", "UAFMHG6P7"], "count": 3}]}, {"client_msg_id": "8960a5eb-a9e0-4567-a4aa-f01ee2958809", "type": "message", "text": "Please tell us how you did this o yoda", "user": "U2WJRF8QN", "ts": "1600332811.455000", "team": "T2PT41LM9", "blocks": [{"type": "rich_text", "block_id": "7=o", "elements": [{"type": "rich_text_section", "elements": [{"type": "text", "text": "Please tell us how you did this o yoda"}]}]}], "thread_ts": "1600332393.454600", "parent_user_id": "U2UVCQ4ET"}, {"client_msg_id": "699225e3-c05e-435e-928b-e46a07b63aef", "type": "message", "text": "next RACI will be imposed on you", "user": "U2ZUSLTFY", "ts": "1600332854.455200", "team": "T2PT41LM9", "blocks": [{"type": "rich_text", "block_id": "Tfzz", "elements": [{"type": "rich_text_section", "elements": [{"type": "text", "text": "next RACI will be imposed on you"}]}]}], "thread_ts": "1600332393.454600", "parent_user_id": "U2UVCQ4ET"}, {"client_msg_id": "50C5FEA3-FC46-4CF5-A15D-53CB8ABA4676", "type": "message", "text": "I use raci to describe the difference between product manager and po.

Test specialists don't see themselves as developers. Operations folks don't see themselves as developers. UX designers don't see themselves as developers. It's true what <@U3K3ESCA1> said that they all develop something, and I can usually get them to see that, but it would make it easier. On the flip side, \"business people\" includes customers and users who may not see themselves as \"business people\". It boils down to a need for close collaboration among all relevant stakeholders throughout the effort.\n\u2022 \"The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.\" I think this is true, but it's also not helpful, especially looking back on the last few months. Face-to-face may be the most efficient and effective, but it's not always right for the business. Better tools - higher fidelity video and voice chat, screen sharing, electronic whiteboards, various improvements to asynchronous communication tools - have made being apart less painful than it was in the 1990s and early 2000s. I don't know what the right balance between tradeoffs it, but I do know that the idea that \"you can't be agile with distributed teams\" is wrong, and this point gives off that kind of vibe.\nEvery other thing brought up here is more of a people issue that can't really be helped by changing anything in the Manifesto itself. I would feel that anyone who spent 15 minutes to read and think about the words written and then some more time challenging their own assumptions about the world would get through these problems.
